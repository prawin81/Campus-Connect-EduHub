    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      This Student Management System project is designed to simplify and automate the daily administrative tasks of educational institutions. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing student records including their personal details, academic performance, and enrollment information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system allows staff to efficiently add, edit, delete, and search student data in real-time, thereby improving accuracy and saving valuable time. The project has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly web application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This application aims to assist teachers, administrative staff, and management in keeping track of student information with minimal errors and better organization. It also helps students and parents to access relevant information easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is a part of the college curriculum and demonstrates practical application of front-end development concepts, DOM manipulation, and data handling in JavaScript.
